## Sub-Heading ##

## Summary ##
  > The product we will be building is a web application designed to help students communicate with each other. The goal is to help students better understand subjects by having them teach each other. The benefit of doing this is that students will have the ability to communicate with each other and deepen their understanding on subjects. Sometimes it is easier to understand something when a classmate explains it in a different way than the teacher. 

## Problem ##
  > The target audience is anyone who is in school or in a learning program. It is for teachers to have students engage with each other. The problem being the lack of peer learning due to this covid world. Many students aren't able to understand their classes due to the lack of a classroom setting. Students also aren't able to really talk to each other via zoom. 

## Solution ##
  > Our product solves the problem expressed above by simulating a classroom setting. Not only will students be able to help each other and learn from each other we will also provide extra resources to help students learn on their own and then help one another. 


## Key Technical Challenge ##
  > The most challenging and techincal hurdles we must overcome to successfully fufill the needs of our app is figuring out the best way to make data accessible for students and teachers.

## Extension Opportunities ##
  > To make our app more secure and verifed, we plan on having a mandatory test that will need to be completed in order for a teacher to successfully create an account. We also plan on adding an edit profile feature for students and teachers.
